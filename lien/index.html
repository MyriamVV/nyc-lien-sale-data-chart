<div class="intro">


    <p>The sale is a mechanism in which the city sells people’s property tax debt to private trusts of investors who then collect the debt from the owners with high interests. The department of finance identifies the properties by tax lots, explained the New York City Architect Jorge Fontan. The institution then publishes a list with all the lots whose debt will be sold.</p> 

    <p>Historically, the most affected people have been non-white communities. Activists are working to find the property owners and help them with the paperwork to get their houses off the list. This can be difficult because, as Fontan said, “you can have one lot with many addresses, even one building can have more than one address.”</p>
